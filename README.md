ML Model deployment in GCP:

This Repository  uses a dataset from Kaggle to predict the chances of the admission of a student into
foreign universities based on different evaluation criteria. This book tries to explain the
concepts simply, extensively, and thoroughly to approach the problem from scratch and then its deployment to a cloud environment.

1. The Problem statement: The goal here is to find the chance of admission of a candidate based on his/her 
GRE Score (out of 340), 
TOEFL Score (out of 120), 
rating of the University (out of 5) in which he/she is trying to get admission, 
Strength of the SOP (out of 5),
